::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After following this episode, participants should be able to...

1. Articulate goals and expectations of the workshop
2. Identify motivating biological questions that necessitate the use of abundance and trait data

## Introduction

In this first episode we will go over:
- instructor introductions
- discussing the expectations of the learners
- introducing the toy data set we'll be using
- system requirements


## Our exciting (toy) data

We'll be using some fake data that we simulated using Hawaiian arthropods as inspiration.  The data contain real taxonomic names (so we can use workflows designed for dealing with taxonomic data) but the abundances and traits are compltely made up.

However (!) we made up the abundances and traits to try to capture a realistic and compelling story.  The Hawaiian Islands formed over a volcanic hotspot, as such Kauai is about 5 million years old, while the Big Island is still forming.

Dawson shows how the ecosystems of the Hawaiian Islands change across the the chronosequence, while an overlaid false-color map shows the substrates age of the islands, which the substrates of the Big Island being youngest, progressing in increasing age toward Kauai](intro_img/intro_01.png)

This *chronosequence* provides a natural eco-evolutionary experiment where we might hypothesize different processes are more prevalent at different and less so at others


![A figure showing how hypothesized mechanisms might trade-off across the chronosequence: in communities on older substrates we might expect more time for evolution and consequently assembly by speciation and competitive coexistence being important.  In contrast on younger substrates we might expect less time for evolution and thus assembly by immigration and neutral ecological drift being important](intro_img/intro_02.png)

What data could we bring to bear on exploring these hypothesized changes in assembly processes?  Abundance data and trait data are common go-to's in ecology and evolution

Using real taxonomic names from Hawaiian arthropods we simulated data based on the hypothesis that speciation and competitive coexistence drive assembly of communities on older substrates while immigration and evological neutrality drive assembly on younger sites.  Middle-age sites are simualted as an intermediate between those two extremes.

::: discussion

- What patterns do you see in the data?
- How could you summarize these data?
