## Four types of MDBD

In this workshop, we'll be working with four types of biodiversity data: species **abundances**, **population genetics**, **traits**, and **phylogenetics**. These are data types you have probably worked with or heard of separately, but, depending on your area of specialization, you probably have not worked closely with all of them, or with all of them all at once! In this workshop, we'll brush up on skills for working with each data type separately, and then explore what we can accomplish when we integrate multiple data types into the same analysis. 

To make this a little more interesting, let's explore this with a real-world (or, close to real-world) example!

### Hawaii islands narrative (TODO - Andy please fill in!)

For this workshop, we'll be working with some _simulated_ data loosely based on arthropods found in the Hawaiian archipelago. ...

Outline:

* introduce island-age situation
* introduce data types and illustrate/explain what they mean in terms of field collection
* break for discussion/naive hypotheses chatting

::: instructor

Breakout groups or collaborate on the white board. 

:::

::: discussion

How would you expect genetic diversity, species diversity, trait, or phylogenetic diversity to vary with island age?

:::

## Workshop logistics and preview

For the rest of the workshop, we'll take a tour of the data types and then bring them together.
