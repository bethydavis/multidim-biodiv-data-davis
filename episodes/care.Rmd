::: questions
-   What is Indigenous data sovereignty?
-   What are the CARE principles?
-   What is Local Contexts Hub, and how can we use it to implement the CARE principles in our work? 
:::

::: objectives
After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1.  Articulate the mission of Local Contexts in the context of the CARE and FAIR principles
3.  Create an account on Local Contexts Hub
4.  Create a project on Local Contexts Hub
2.  Apply Bio-Cultural and Traditional Knowledge Notices appropriately to datasets

## Indigenous data soverginty

To aid in our learning about and discussion of Indigenous data soverginty we will watch this video from [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/):

## The CARE Principles

The [CARE principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care) developed by [Stephanie Russo Carroll *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00892-0) codify Indigenous data sovereignty into actionable standards for data governance.  The CARE principles are designed to live alongside and make more just the FAIR principles.  The FAIR principles are seen as also being a necessary of Indigenous data sovereignty and governance

### Collective benefit

Collective benefit means that the communities from which data are gathered should share in any benefit derived from those data.

### Authority to control

Authority to control means that communities have the right and authority to govern how data pertaining to themselves (their cultures, knowledges, bodies, environments) is gathered, used, shared, and re-used.

### Responsibility

Responsibility refers to the requirement that researchers engage with respect in the process of working with local communities, including the ethics of those communities

### Ethics

Ethics speaks to the fact that the ethics of local communities must be respected and privileged when making governing decisions about data


## Implementing the CARE Principles through the Local Contexts Hub

Local Contexts Hub serves Traditional Knowledge [Labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/) and [Notices](https://localcontexts.org/notice/tk-notice/), and Biocultural [Labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/biocultural-labels/) and [Notices](https://localcontexts.org/notice/bc-notice/).  We learned about those in the video from Local Contexts, now we'll learn how Labels and Notices can operationalize the CARE principles.

Follow along with this [slide deck](https://github.com/role-model/multidim-biodiv-data/blob/main/instructors/local_contexts-care.pdf).

::: discussion

How do we use Local Contexts Hub as a tool for collaboration and co-production with local communities?

:::


::: keypoints
- "Be FAIR and CARE": The CARE principles (**C**ollective benefit, **A**uthority to control, **R**esponsibility, and **E**thics) are part of a framework emphasizing Indigenous rights and interests in the context of data sharing ecosystems.
- Local Contexts Hub provides Labels and Notices for learning more about and engaging with Indigenous data in accordance with the CARE principles. 
- Work remains to be done in order to spread the use of TK and BC Labels/Notices by researchers and data repositories
