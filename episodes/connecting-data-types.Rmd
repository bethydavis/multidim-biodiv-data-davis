::: questions

- How do you put all these different types of data together?
- What analyses can we do with multiple data types simultaneously?
- How do we visualize multiple data types concurrently?

::: objectives

After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1. Identify when data from different dimensions can and cannot be synthesized (based, e.g., on sufficient overlap in taxonomy and similar spatial extent/resolution)
1. Join data by space, time, and taxonomy
1. Visualize joint data plots (flesh this out more, e.g. traits on a phylo, phylo and gen div, gen div and abund, etc)
