## High-level Goals

- good practices in lesson design/practices
- how to work with Carpentries infrastructure 
- how to collaborate effectively on open source project like this (using GitHub)
- by the end of this week we should have a skeleton of a workshop and assignments for fleshing that out
- should test out that curriculum before March when we come back together for collaboration training


## Day 1


### Our First Exercise (10 minutes)

What was the best lesson you ever followed (were taught in a class, read through online, read in a book)? Try to differentiate between what was good about the performance of the teacher/trainer and what was good about the content of the lesson itself. Take a few minutes to write down some notes about your answer, then introduce yourself to the other participants and tell them about it.

- Renata - I learned introductory mathematical modeling/game theory from someone who came from math to biology. She would use the class as a micro-experiment - we'd start the day playing through different games and see what happened within the classroom. Then she would go into lecture based on what we'd observed, only formalized through math and at larger experimental scales. It was really effective for waking people up and giving folks links between direct experience and a pretty abstract topic. Most people in the room were not self-identified game theoreticians, but I think most of us left feeling like we could interpret a game theory piece reasonably accurately. 
- Connor - My undergraduate Biostatistics course. The instructor was engaging. The content was interactive- there would be a period of lecture followed by problem solving that we did ourselves and responded through an online survey system. Each lesson had clear goals and the exercises were designed to reinforce what was just taught without taking too much time. Even though it was a large class size, it felt like a smaller workshop and really solidified statistical concepts for me. The instructor often used fun and/or relevant examples for the exercises that made doing them interesting.
- Andy - This is the first that comes to mind (though it might not be best *ever*) but I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Hxu4coDl8&ab_channel=PositPBC) talk/tutorial rolling out [quarto](https://quarto.org/). The instructors/speakers had very clear goals in what they were tyring to explain in each section, they were well organinized and built off each other's content, they were clearly excited about the content, they motivated each "learning goal" with an exciting example
- Isaac: I really like Luke Harmon's [phylogenetic comparative methods book](https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapters/). It's clean, and presents complex ideas in a super simple way. It has a good balance of explanation, examples, figures, and hands-on activities. I also always really appreciate [The Socks of Karl Broman](https://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/10/tiny-data-and-the-socks-of-karl-broman/) as a super fun and accessible intro to Bayesian thinking and approximate Bayesian computation.
    - [name=Sarah]: Karl works here at UW-Madison!  He teaches the local Carpentries workshops sometimes too!  I've not read his Socks blog post and will have to take a look.
- Jacob: The time that sticks in my mind is when I demoed some a set of chemistry teaching games called Collisions Chemistry at a National Science Teachers Association meeting when I was an undergraduate. [example of someone playing one of the games here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh_gDAafRAQ) I remember being really enamoured by how fun the game itself was, which spurred me to keep playing - it was definitely triggering my reward pathway. It was so interactive, feeling like a sandbox for how things worked where I could explore different combinations of real and counterfactual molecules. After playing I remember feeling like I understood the concepts WAY better than I ever did in high school chemistry. 
- Rilquer Mascarenhas - I can think of a book I read recently for discussion with my undergrads. The book is about molecular evolution, with several chapters from how to obtain data to how DNA sequences are analyzed in order to derive evolutionary history from them. Particularly, I thought the chapter about phylogenetic inference was very well suited for beginners, such as the group in which we were discussing. The chapter had a lot of visual explanations and analogies to help the students visualize and connect concepts in their minds. Also, the pace of the reading in that chapter felt adequate, considering the amount of new concepts introduced when youâ€™re learning/teaching phylogenetic inference. Finally, each concept presented built on the previous one very nicely.


**Key Points**:
- This training aims to teach you a process for designing and developing a lesson website, in collaboration with others.

### Lesson Design

**Questions**:
- What lesson do you want to develop during and after this workshop?

**Objectives**:
After following this part of the training, participants should be able to...
- summarise the lessons that participants will be working on.

We'll be using [Nicholl's 5 phase process](https://f1000research.com/documents/9-1377):

1. define what learners will be able to do (aka learning outcomes)
2. choosing learning experiences
3. developing content to support experiences
4. assessing learning progress
5. evaluating outcomes, experiences, content

We'll use "formative assesment" (instead of "summative assesment") given the short format of the workshop and oppurtunity to immediate feedback on learning

![Modified Lesson Design process diagram of Nicholl's 5 phases](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_52559ae52e2362b8aaf4eb380da15c1c.png)

#### Discussion (10 minutes)
Take a few minutes to think about your answers to the following questions:

- What is the topic of the lesson that you plan to develop based on this training?
- Have you created training material on this topic before?
- What is motivating you to create this lesson?

**Participant thoughts:**

- Andy 
    - Topic: wrangling heterogeneous biodiversity data, engaging with open respositories of such data, learning about ethics associated with such data, especially history of scientific rasism in genetics and ongoing challenges of Indigenous data sovereignty
    - I have created material on this before
    - Motivation: biodiversity science is increasingly computaitonal but this presents a barrier to entry into the domain for a sizable number of scholars, a good educational resource could lower that barrier 
- Connor - 
    1. Managing, analyzing, and modeling multidimensional biodiversity data
    2. No. I've created material tangential to this, but not this topic specifically (e.g. R/data science topics, genetics topics)
    3. ~~Introducing early career scientists to the MESS/RoLE model~~ and empowering people to analyze multidimensional biodiversity data
- Jacob
    - Handling multidimensional biodiversity data, for me with emphasis on learning to use an R package, both to use the package in research and as a tool for understanding concepts
    - Nope, I have never created material like this before.
    - Teaching people about this approach is needed - this approach is burgeoning but the resources to learn it are lacking 
- Renata
    - Topic: 1. Data wrangling, analysis, archiving, and ethics ( +1 Andy) of multiple linked data streams (e.g. genetic sequencing, species abundance data); 2. Using and interpreting process simulation models for ecological and evolutionary dynamics (second phase)
    - Past materials: I've created data analysis curricula, but not for these specific topics.
    - Motivation: We're planning to offer workshops in this vein this summer. We'd also like to make this curriculum open-source and reusable down the line.  
- Isaac
    *  Topic: What Renata said :grin:
    *  Past materials: We did a _somewhat_ similar workshop about [MESS](https://compphylo.github.io/Oslo2019/MESS_files/MESS_PartI.html) a couple years ago.
    *  Motivation: I think there's a need in the community for lessons around this material!

- Rilquer
    * Topic: Management and wrangling of multi-dimensional biological data.
    * Training material: Introductory material for intro to R and data wrangling
    * Motivation: increase the accessibility of people to using different kinds of biodiversity data in order to help them answer complex scientific questions.


**Key Points**:
- There can be many reasons to create a new lesson.
- This training will give you a process to follow to ensure your lesson is effective.

### Identifying Your Target Audience

**Questions**:
- What are the recommended steps to take when developing a new lesson?
- Why is it so important to think about the target audience early in the process?
- How can you ensure that your lesson reaches the right audience?


**Objectives**:
After following this part of the training, participants should be able to...
- describe the importance of aligning lesson design with the intended audience.
- compose a list of prior knowledge required to follow a lesson.

#### The Lesson Design Process We Will Use
1. Define desired learning outcomes
1. Decide with what activities/examples/explanations we will try to teach these skills
1. Create assessments to determine progress towards desired outcomes
1. Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the next
1. (After the break) evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives


#### Defining the audience:

- lessons are short (in time) and so content must be cut to make it all fit, keeping the target audience in mind helps make these hard decisions
- [docker lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/docker-introduction/) is a good example in making these decisions
- what level of expertise do we expect our learners to arrive with?**

![graphic of experience level from novice to competent practitioner to expert](https://codimd.carpentries.org/uploads/upload_6b442bbe747328fad0bad5ee75a8278b.png)

- Expertise determines:
    - what's the prior knowledge learners are expected to have?
    - what's the mental model learners come in with?
    - what misconceptions might learners arrive with?
    - E.g.
        - notices learn best from guided examples but not a lot of extra content, just keep them focused on one specific goal
        - but worked examples and step-by-step examples with a competent practitioner could be detrimental because they get distracted by details they already know
        - competent practitioners do best with more freedom to explore and build on what they already know
- Keep in mind learner motivation
    - what do they *want* to learn?
    - what do they *need* to learn?
    - what value will they see in your lesson?
    - what are their competing priorities?
    - what would they already know?
    - what might be their misconceptions?
    - remember: we're not the learners, so try to put ourselves in their shoes 
- **WHAT TO DO ABOUT MULTIPLE LEVELS IN ONE LEARNER COMMUNITY?!?!**
    - regular assement will help
    - be really clear about what background we expect
    - does less harm to target curriculum at novices because being bored in the workshop is less bad than people leaving because they feel like computing isn't for them
    - assuming novice level makes for easier lesson planning because you start with assumption of no prior knowledge 
    - fine to assume some prior knowledge and point novices to background material

#### Exercise: Thinking About Target Audience (15 minutes total)
**Part 1 (5 minutes)**: think about a member of the target audience for your lesson, and answer the following questions in the context of your lesson topic:

1. What is their background?
1. What do they already know how to do?
1. What do they want to do with the skills they will learn from your lesson?
1. What problem will your lesson help them solve?

---
#### Our consensus answers
1. What is their background?
    * "Early-career" empirical biologist with interest in studying multiple dimensions of biodiversity
    * "mid-stage PhD student who's completed course work, done some analysis"
    * knows something about eco and evo concepts covered in courses
    * not as much experience making own models from scratch
1. What do they already know how to do?
    * Operate some coding environment with novice++ level skill (can be python or R or whatever).
    * they've taken eco-evo courses, they know the concepts i.e. island biogeography
1. What do they want to do with the skills they will learn from your lesson?
    * They want to be able to wrangle their own data. Operate and ask questions about multidimensional biodiversity data.
1. What problem will your lesson help them solve?
    * How to make the most of their data. How to ask and answer biological questions from large scale data.

---

**Part 2 (10 minutes)**: Share your answers with your collaborators. How do they compare? If you have identified different audiences, are they compatible? Or would your time be better spent focussing on one particular audience for this lesson?


#### Exercise: Defining Prerequisite Knowledge (5 minutes)
Write a list of the skills/knowledge your learners will be required to have before they can follow your lesson.

If you are struggling with this exercise because your lesson audience is novices, think about skills like touch typing, using a web browser, or interacting with a command line or graphical interface. These are skills commonly overlooked by experts and competent practitioners.

- Rilquer
    - Knowledge on eco-evo concepts
    - Basic knowledge of coding (such as in R or Python) to input and visualize data.
    - Experience with basics statistical analysis in a coding environment
- Renata
    - knowledge of eco and evo
    - some interest in linking the two
    - basic R (I think this workshop will be R-flavored for simplicity) skills: data import, basic summary stats on a particular data type (maybe).
    - interest in adding additional data types to their skillset
    - possibly have an inkling of or an actual dataset they would like to use if they could
- Jacob
    - basic understanding of island biogeography, concepts of local and metacommunity, natural selection
    - awareness of one or more datatypes, maybe a datatype that are most interested or experienced in
    - equivalent of carpentries R intro course "Introduction to R and RStudio"
    - thinking virtually everyone that knows Python will also know R, so RStudio as an expectation may be fine?
    - reading tabular data
- Isaac
    - Operating RStudio and/or a python analog (jupyter).
    - Familiarity with _one or more_ focal datatypes (SADs, phylogenies, traits, popgen).
- Connor
    - have some experience using a coding language, but aren't experts
    - knowledge of fundamental eco & evo concepts
    - they know about different data types, but don't necessarily know how to use them or what consitutes them
- Andy 
    - knowledge of the concepts of ecology and evoltuion
    - exposure to the *ideas* of different data types (e.g. phylogenies *exist* but they might not have detailed knowledge of how those data are stored or how to work with them)
    - at least a few times they have copy pasted R code to do an analysis or make a vizualization and modified that code as needed
    - experience reading tabular data into R


It would be great if we could identify some prereq online materials where learners could gain the prior skills they need (or check that they have those skills already), e.g.:
- carpentries R and RStudio
- carpentries ecology
    - (is there an analog for popgen, phylo data?)




**Key Points**:
- We recommend an iterative lesson design process that begins with identifying the target audience, before defining learning outcomes, then creating assessments, writing explanatory content, and evaluating the lesson in a workshop.
- Thinking about the target audience early in the design process helps to ensure that your lesson is built around the needs and motivations of real people.
- Use the description of your target audience to help attract people with the appropriate interests and prior knowledge to your lesson.

**Please give us feedback**: https://forms.gle/Af7rk8NN4v6L25C77


### Defining Lesson Objectives/Outcomes

**Questions**:
- How can describing the things you intend to teach aid the process of writing a lesson?
- How can you be specific and realistic about what you will teach in your lesson?
- What are some of the risks associated with unrealistic or undefined expectations of a lesson?


**Objectives**:
After following this part of the training, participants should be able to...
- explain the importance of defining specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound objectives for a lesson.
- evaluate a written lesson objective according to these criteria.


Focus on the skills rather than the tools. Cognititve skills at that! This requires foundation of info we have to build up before they can creatively apply those skills

Structure learning objectives in modular way so you can cut whole sections if time requires

Writing objectives:
- objective starts with partial sentence like "participants should be able to..."
- follow up with verbs that can be assessed
- some verbs are easier to assess than others (e.g. "understand" is hard to assess)
- use [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/) - a framework for learning objectives which some educational professionals use


#### SMART Objectives Should Be...
* **Specific**: they should clearly describe a particular skill or ability the learner should have.
* **Measurable**: it should be possible to observe and ascertain when the learner has learned the skill/abilities described in the objectives.
* **Attainable**: the learner should realistically be able to acquire the skills or abilities in the time available in a workshop/by following the text of the lesson.
* **Relevant**: they should be relevant to the overall topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.
* **Time-bound**: they should include some timeframe within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is built into the approach described above.
* some resources on SMART objectives (one source of SMART is from project managemnt and defining goals and objectives of a project):
    * [UC Berkeley](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf)
    * [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)




#### Exercise: evaluating learning objectives (15 minutes)
Look at the example learning objectives below. Fill in the table for each objective, checking :heavy_check_mark: off the cells if you think an objective meets the criteria or leaving it unchecked if not. You should assume each objective is for a lesson to be taught in a two-day workshop. Note down any observations you make as you move through the list. If you have time, try to imagine the titles of lessons that would have these objectives. This part of the exercise should take 10 minutes.

At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. create formatted page content with Markdown.
1. program with Rust.
1. fully understand GitHub Actions.


| Objective | Action verb? | Specific | Measurable | Attainable |
| --------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1         | x  x x x  x  | x x x x  | x x x x x  | x x x x  x |
| 2         | x  x  x x  x |          |            | x          |
| 3         | x  x         | x  x     |            | x x x      |



In the last five minutes of the exercise, 
we will discuss as a group how each objective might be improved.


**Improvements**
- objective 1: what is "formatted"? would be better to list formatting objectives clearly
- objective 2: lacking specificity, thus not measurable, attainable
- objective 3: is it even an action verb? not specific 


**Lesson scope helps...**
- articulate objectives
- prioritize objectives (and which might need to be cut)

#### Exercise: defining objectives for your lesson (20 minutes)
Write learning objectives for your lesson - what do you want learners to be able to do at the end of the workshop? When writing these lesson-level objectives, try to follow the SMART framework: make them specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.


#### Exercise: Reviewing Lesson Objectives (15 minutes)
Swap objectives written in the previous exercise with a partner
(you can also explain or show them what you wrote about your target audience, but this not essential)
and review them with the following questions in mind:

- Are the objectives clear?
- Do they use "action" verbs?
- Could you directly observe whether a learner had reached this objective?

Now run the objectives through [this Lesson Objective Advisor tool from the University of Manchester's Faculty of Science and Engineering](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/iloadvisor/).
Do the results match your assessment?

- Where do the skills described in these objectives sit on the scale?
- (optional) Are these objectives realistic, given the target audience of the lesson?




**Rilquer and Andy**

Rilquer:
* Create a dataset using several dimensions of biodiversity data
* Load, explore and visualize multi-dimensional data
* Identify and implement useful practices of data organization for sharing
* Create a repository to share biodiversity data
* Articulate hypotheses that would neccesitate multi-dimensional biodiversity data
* Identify which data would address those hypotheses

Thoughts:
* "dataset" might be vauge
* could improve "dataset" by being more explicit about capturing different scales and levels of taxonomy, time, and space


Andy:

After following this part of the workshop, participants should be able to...

1. Import community, organismal, population genetic, and phylogenetic data into R
1. Summarize those data using informative statistics such as Hill numbers
1. Compile synthetic datasets of heterogeneous data by leveraging community standards and metadata languages such as Darwin Core and Ecological Metadata Language
1. Compile synthetic datasets of heterogeneous data by harmonizing the differing scales of those data
1. Identify situations where data can and cannot be integrated (e.g. by connecting the scale of a scientific question to the geographic scope and resolution of the data)
1. Share data via domain-specific online repositories such as GEOME
1. Connect (via DOI) data with online repositories tracking Indigenous provenance such as Local Contexts Hub
1. Discuss historical context of biological data with respect to scientific racism 

Thoughts:
- wtf is "harmonize"
- "discussing historical context" is hard to measure

* Describe the distinction between synthetic and real MBDB datasets. Identify which questions are best addressed by one or both approaches.
* Use R (roleR + roleShiny) to run and examine the results of a process model


**NOTE** We can use *Questions* to articulate learning outcomes that the learners can more easily interpret while *Objectives* might be hard for learners to interpret at first (e.g. an objective might be "will be able to define term xyz" so the learner wouldn't know that term before the lesson)

**Key Points**:
* Defining objectives for a lesson can help to focus your content on the most important outcomes, and outline the scope of the project.
* Following the SMART framework can help make your learning objectives as useful as possible.
* Leaving objectives unrealistic or undefined increases the risk of a lesson losing focus or spending time on activities that do not help learners gain the most important skills.
