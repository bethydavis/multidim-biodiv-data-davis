::: objectives

After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1. Identify key features of different pop gen data formats
1. Import pop gen data in multiple formats into the R environment
2. Clean taxonomic names using the `taxize` package
3. Manipulate pop gen data by adding and removing sequences
3. Alignment??
3. Site frequency spectrum??
3. Calculate genetic diversity $\pi$
4. Calculate Hill numbers
5. Interpret Hill numbers
6. Visualize SFS??
6. Visualize genetic diversity distributions
8. Connect genetic diversity distributions to Hill numbers


## Methods for connecting different data types

::: questions

- How do you put all these different types of data together?

:::::::::::::


::: objectives

After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1. Identify when data from different dimensions can and cannot be synthesized (based, e.g., on sufficient overlap in taxonomy and similar spatial extent/resolution)
1. Join data by space, time, and taxonomy
1. Visualize joint data plots (flesh this out more, e.g. traits on a phylo, phylo and gen div, gen div and abund, etc)

## Finding multi-dimensional data


::: questions

- Where do multi-dimensional biodiversity data live online?
- How can we combine online resources to assemble multi-dimensional datasets?
- How can we use R to retrieve data?

:::::::::::::


::: objectives

After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1. List online repositories (kinda lame)
1. Retrieve data from xyz (insert repo names here, e.g. GEOME) using R and APIs
1. Assemble a synthetic data set of multiple dimensions of biodiversity from multiple online sources

::::::::::::::

### NOTES

- do we talk about metadata standards here? or under each data type episode? or below under contributing data????


## Contributing multi-dimensional data


::: questions

- How do you share your own data?

:::::::::::::


::: objectives

After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1. Describe their data using community metadata standards (e.g. Darwin Core, MIxS, etc)
2. Create a data record on GEOME

::::::::::::::




## Incorporating CARE principles by connecting data to Local Contexts Hub

::: questions

- What is Indigenous data sovereignty?
- What are the CARE principles?
- How can we incorperate these principles into our data work?

:::::::::::::


::: objectives

After following this episode, we intend that participants will be able to:

1. Articulate the mission of Local Contexts Hub in the context of the CARE and FAIR principles
1. Apply Bio-Cultural and Traditional Knowledge Notices appropriately to datasets
1. Create an account on Local Contexts Hub
1. Create a project on Local Contexts Hub
1. Query the Local Contexts Hub API to link a dataset with project IDs on Local Contexts Hub
