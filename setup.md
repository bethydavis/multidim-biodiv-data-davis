title: Setup
---

Setup instructions live in this document. Please specify the tools and the data
sets the Learner needs to have installed.

## Learner expectations
We expect learners to have some familiarity with R, including a few basic concepts:
- what a function is and how to assign output of a function to an object, e.g. `object <- function(x)`
- read in tabular data, e.g. `read.csv()` for comma-separated values files
- bracket indexing, e.g. understanding that `data[,3]` returns the third column of the `data` dataframe.
- install and load packages, e.g. `install.packages()` and `library()`

If you need a bit of catching up, no worries! The Software Data Carpentries has a nice [Introduction to R and RStudio workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) that will get you up to speed. The episodes up to and including "Subsetting Data" will get you where you need to be for this workshop. 

Additionally, you will need to have the latest versions of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) downloaded onto your personal computer.

## Software Setup

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `solution`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
